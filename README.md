=======
Ball-by-ball data for all cricket T20 international matches so far.

The files that you can use for analysis are in the cleaned_data folder. These files create ball-by-ball details for individual games. The data for a game with the game id <x> is stored in <x>_summary.csv

Below is a summary of what some of the headers in the summary file entail:
- 'batsman' refers to the player id of the batsman
- 'bowler' refers to the player id of the bowler
- 'bat_right_handed' indicates whether the player is left or right handed
- 'x' and 'y' refer to the coordinates of where the ball ended up after it was hit.
-   'x' is 0 when it reaches the left-most region of the ground (the point boundary for a right hander) and is 360 when it reaches the right-most region of the ground (the point boundary for a right hander).
-   'y' is 0 when the ball reaches the boundary straight down the ground (i.e., after a perfect straight drive), and is 360 when it reaches the boundary after going over the keeper's head
- 'z' refers to the zone in which a ball was hit. z=1 is the fine-leg zone, z=2 is the zone behind square leg, z=3 is the zone in front of square leg etc. This progress all the way until z=8, which is the third-man area.
- landing_x refers to the distance (in meters) away from the centre of the pitch that the ball lands. A negative value indicates the ball landed outside off-stump for a right-hander and outside leg-stump for a left-hander.
- landing_y refers to the distance (in meters) away from the batsman stumps that a ball lands. A negative value indicates a full toss.
- ended_x refers to the distance (in meters) away from the centre of the pitch that the ball ends up when it reaches the batsman. A negative value indicates the ball landed outside off-stump for a right-hander and outside leg-stump for a left-hander.
- ended_y refers to the height (in meters) above the pitch by the time it reaches the batsman.
- ball_speed refers to the speed of the ball in miles per hour
- control refers to whether or not the batsman middled the ball (1=middled, 0=not middled)
